### ‚úã Hi there, I'm Alec
 
My favorite language is C#. You can read about all of the cool features that I've used and facts that I've discovered, or you can scroll to the bottom and take a peek at my favorite tools. If you want to learn more about my experience, feed free to head over to my [about page](https://adv68.github.io/adv68/ABOUT).

__‚ö° Fun fact: C# is the greatest language__.

Okay, maybe it's not a fact, but C# is pretty great...

I've been working with it for almost 3 years now, and here's my favorite parts:
- Built-in async/await
- Json Serialization: going to and from json is a breeze
- SignalR: Websockets plus some other goodies, and it only takes like 20 lines of .NET code to get it running.
- Entity Framework: Postgres is my favorite DB, what's yours?
- ASP.NET Core: Yep, I realize, this one's a bit broad, but when you combine all the other great parts of .NET into a web framework, what's not to like about it?
- Reflection: Why access a field directly when you can manipulate it through its type? And how about those *magical* attributes? (No need to fret, it's just reflection).
- Pointers and pass-by-reference: you can be as dangerous as you'd like. Want to pretend you're in C for a day? No problem, just put it in an "unsafe" block!
- Interop with native unmanaged platforms: Python üêç, you're not the only one who can call C libraries.

__‚ö° Another fun fact: the Azure App Service Front-End runs on ASP.NET Core, using Kestrel and YARP, see more details [here](https://azure.github.io/AppService/2022/08/16/A-Heavy-Lift.html).__

__‚ö° An even funner (is that even a word?) fact: .NET is *CROSS PLATFORM*__.

I use Windows (albeit begrudgingly at times). Microsoft did a pretty good job on Visual Studio, so I'm kind of forced to use Windows if I want VS. Linux is pretty awesome though too.

__Other Cool Toys:__

- If your looking for a great terminal on Windows 10, check out [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal).
- How about the re-birth of Win95 and XP's [PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys)? My favorite tools are FancyZones and the Color Picker.
- Ohh, and my favorite JS front-end framework: [SvelteJS](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte). If you're looking to try something new (and fun), try out SvelteJS + SvelteKit + TailwindCSS + TypeScript. I've played around with that stack a bit and am a big fan.
